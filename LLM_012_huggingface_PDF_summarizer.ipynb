        "To ensure that the summarization actually **reduces the text** rather than simply repeating it, you can adjust several aspects of the summarization process. The key lies in how you control the length of the generated summary and the granularity of the text chunks being summarized.\n",

        "   - The `chunk_size` parameter controls how much text from the PDF is passed to the summarizer at once.\n",
        "   - The `max_length` and `min_length` parameters control the length of each summary chunk.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "- **Smaller `chunk_size` (500)**: This ensures smaller portions of text are summarized at a time, allowing the summarizer to focus on condensing the information.\n",
        "- **Shorter summaries with `max_length=50` and `min_length=25`**: The summaries will now be much shorter and more concise, focusing on extracting key information rather than simply repeating the text.\n",
