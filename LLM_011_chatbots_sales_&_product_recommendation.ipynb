        "   - **What you learn**: Extracting information from user input.\n",
        "   - **Key Part of the Code**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if \"budget\" in message.lower():\n",
        "         # Simple budget extraction logic\n",
        "         try:\n",

        "         except:\n",
        "             budget = 100  # Default to 100 if extraction fails\n",
        "     if \"recommend\" in message.lower() or \"looking for\" in message.lower():\n",
        "         preferences = message.lower()\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - **Lesson**: This part of the code demonstrates how to **parse user input** to extract important information like **budget** and **preferences**. You use basic string matching (e.g., `\"budget\" in message.lower()`) and a simple way to extract numbers from the message.\n",
        "   - **Why It Matters**: In real-world scenarios, parsing input from natural language is key to understanding customer needs. This can be extended with natural language processing (NLP) tools for more accurate extraction.\n",
        "   \n",
        "In this code, the bot takes specific actions only if certain keywords, like **\"budget\"**, **\"recommend\"**, or **\"looking for\"**, appear in the user's message. These keywords act as triggers to parse the message and extract the user's preferences or budget.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Customizing the Keyword Triggers:\n",
        "You can easily expand the list of keywords to make the bot more flexible and responsive. This way, the bot can detect a wider range of possible user inputs and take appropriate actions. For example, you could add more keywords for other product-related queries, such as **\"price\"**, **\"suggest\"**, **\"need\"**, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example: Expanding the Keyword List\n",
        "Here's how you could expand the list of keywords based on different user intents:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if any(keyword in message.lower() for keyword in [\"budget\", \"price\", \"cost\"]):\n",
        "    # Simple budget extraction logic\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "        budget = int([word for word in message.split() if word.isdigit()][0])\n",
        "    except:\n",
        "        budget = 100  # Default to 100 if extraction fails\n",

        "if any(keyword in message.lower() for keyword in [\"recommend\", \"looking for\", \"suggest\", \"show me\"]):\n",
        "    preferences = message.lower()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Updates:\n",
        "1. **Budget-Related Keywords**:\n",
        "   - You’ve expanded to include other potential words the user might use when discussing money: **\"price\"** and **\"cost\"**.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Recommendation-Related Keywords**:\n",
        "   - Instead of just triggering on **\"recommend\"** or **\"looking for\"**, the bot now also recognizes other common phrases like **\"suggest\"** and **\"show me\"**.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Flexible Matching**:\n",
        "   - Using a list of keywords with the `any()` function allows the bot to respond to a broader range of user inputs, making it more responsive and natural to interact with.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional Example:\n",
        "Let's say you want to handle queries like **\"do you have\"** or **\"can I get\"** to indicate that the user is looking for a product. You could easily add those to the trigger list:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if any(keyword in message.lower() for keyword in [\"recommend\", \"looking for\", \"suggest\", \"show me\", \"do you have\", \"can I get\"]):\n",
        "    preferences = message.lower()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This is Important:\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: The more keywords you account for, the more responsive and natural your chatbot becomes. Users tend to phrase requests in various ways, so expanding the list of triggers helps the bot cover a wider range of queries.\n",
        "- **Customization**: You can adapt the bot to respond to industry-specific language or tailor it to your brand’s tone. For example, if you were designing the bot for a different store, you could include product-specific keywords or promotional terms.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "- **Contextual Triggers**: If you want to go further, you could use more advanced NLP techniques (e.g., intents and entity recognition) to handle more complex or ambiguous queries.\n",
        "- **Personalization**: You could add keywords like **\"my preferences\"** or **\"my usual\"** to detect returning users or those who have a saved profile.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "By expanding the list of keywords, you can make the bot recognize a broader range of user inputs and trigger actions more effectively. This increases the bot’s flexibility and ability to handle real-world conversations."

        "     - You learn how to traverse a product catalog, match items with preferences, and ensure they fall within the budget.\n",
        "     - You also learn **upselling techniques**, like offering special promotions based on total purchases (or product-specific promotions, like the \"buy 2, get 1 free\" offer).\n",

        "\n",
        "   ### Major Features of the Code:\n",
        "This code works because it effectively matches user preferences with available products and dynamically adjusts recommendations based on budget and available promotions. Here’s a breakdown of its major features and why it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Filtering Products Based on User Preferences**:\n",
        "   - **Key Line**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if product_key in preferences.lower():\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - **Explanation**: This part of the code checks whether the product names or keywords (like \"water bottle\", \"flask\", etc.) appear in the user's preferences. This ensures the chatbot recommends products that match the user's request.\n",
        "   - **Why It Works**: It allows the bot to match products with user input in a flexible way (case-insensitive and matching on key terms). It can accommodate different user phrasing (e.g., \"looking for a flask\" vs. \"recommend a water bottle\").\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Price Filtering Based on Budget**:\n",
        "   - **Key Line**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if product_info['price'] <= budget:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - **Explanation**: This line ensures that only products within the user’s specified budget are recommended. If a product exceeds the budget, it will be excluded from the recommendations.\n",
        "   - **Why It Works**: Budget constraints are common in real-world shopping scenarios. By filtering products that exceed the user's budget, the bot provides relevant and affordable options.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Adding Product Promotions**:\n",
        "   - **Key Line**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if 'promotion' in product_info:\n",
        "         recommendation += f\" ({product_info['promotion']})\"\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - **Explanation**: If a product has a promotion (e.g., a discount), it appends the promotion information to the product recommendation.\n",
        "   - **Why It Works**: Offering promotions is an essential part of sales strategy. It adds value to the recommendations by informing users about available discounts, which can drive purchases.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Upselling and Cross-selling Based on Budget**:\n",
        "   - **Key Lines**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if sum([products[key]['price'] for key in products if key in preferences.lower()]) < 100:\n",
        "         recommended.append(f\"Special Promotion: {promotions['order_over_100']}\")\n",
        "     elif \"coffee mug\" in preferences.lower():\n",
        "         recommended.append(f\"Special Promotion: {promotions['buy_2_get_1']}\")\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - **Explanation**: The code checks if the total value of selected products is below a certain threshold (in this case, $100) and adds a promotion like \"10% off orders over $100.\" It also checks if the user is interested in a coffee mug and offers a relevant promotion.\n",
        "   - **Why It Works**: **Upselling** encourages users to spend more by offering discounts if they exceed a certain threshold, while **cross-selling** recommends related products or promotions, driving additional sales.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Suggestions for Improving the Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Handle Complex Preferences**:\n",
        "   - **Current Limitation**: Right now, the code only checks for simple keyword matches (e.g., \"water bottle\" in user preferences).\n",
        "   - **Improvement**: You can enhance the preference matching by using NLP techniques to detect **synonyms** or more complex preferences. For example, users may ask for \"hydration\" products, and you could map that to water bottles or flasks.\n",
        "   - **Implementation**: Use libraries like **spaCy** or **transformers** to extract entities or categorize products more intelligently.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     from spacy import load\n",
        "     nlp = load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n",
        "     \n",
        "     doc = nlp(preferences)\n",
        "     for ent in doc.ents:\n",
        "         # Match entities like \"bottle\", \"drinkware\", etc. to products\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Expand Budget Handling**:\n",
        "   - **Current Limitation**: The budget check is straightforward but could miss more detailed budget instructions, like ranges (\"between $30 and $50\").\n",
        "   - **Improvement**: You can improve the budget extraction logic to handle **price ranges** or conditional requests like \"I don’t want to spend more than $50, but I’m flexible.\"\n",
        "   - **Implementation**: Implement budget parsing with a more robust NLP approach that extracts both minimum and maximum budget limits from user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Improve Upselling Logic**:\n",
        "   - **Current Limitation**: Upselling is only triggered when the total value of selected products is below $100, and promotions are hardcoded for coffee mugs.\n",
        "   - **Improvement**: You can **dynamically trigger promotions** based on the current cart or user behavior. For example, if the user buys a water bottle, suggest a lunchbox or a flask as an add-on.\n",
        "   - **Implementation**: Implement a rule-based or ML-driven system that recommends products dynamically based on the user's choices:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if total < 100:\n",
        "         recommended.append(\"You're $20 away from getting a 10% discount!\")\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Use a Weighted Scoring System for Recommendations**:\n",
        "   - **Current Limitation**: The code currently treats all keyword matches equally.\n",
        "   - **Improvement**: You could implement a **weighted scoring system** that gives higher priority to more relevant products based on user preferences. For example, if a user mentions \"outdoors\" and \"drinkware,\" a water bottle could have a higher score than a coffee mug.\n",
        "   - **Implementation**: Assign weights to each product category based on relevance to the user's query. For example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     product_scores = {\"water bottle\": 5, \"flask\": 4, \"coffee mug\": 3}\n",
        "     if product_key in preferences.lower():\n",
        "         score = product_scores.get(product_key, 0)\n",
        "         recommendation = f\"{product_info['name']} - ${product_info['price']} (Score: {score})\"\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Integrate with Inventory and CRM**:\n",
        "   - **Current Limitation**: The product catalog is static.\n",
        "   - **Improvement**: Integrate the recommendation system with a real-time **inventory management system** and **CRM** to suggest products based on availability, customer behavior, or purchase history. For example, if a product is out of stock, you can recommend an alternative.\n",
        "   - **Implementation**: Use APIs to fetch real-time inventory data or customer profiles from a CRM to offer personalized recommendations:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     inventory = fetch_inventory()  # Real-time stock data\n",
        "     customer_data = fetch_customer_data(customer_id)  # CRM integration\n",
        "     ```\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Enlarging the Scope:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Introduce Personalization with Customer Profiles**:\n",
        "   - Based on user preferences, purchase history, or browsing behavior, you can **personalize recommendations** further. For example, if a user has bought water bottles in the past, you could recommend flasks or hydration packs.\n",
        "   - You could integrate user accounts, so the bot remembers preferences and suggests personalized promotions or products based on previous interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Dynamic Product Promotions**:\n",
        "   - Make promotions dynamic and time-sensitive. You could introduce **seasonal discounts** or limited-time offers that encourage users to make quicker decisions.\n",
        "   - **Implementation**: Use time-based triggers or inventory-based conditions for offering promotions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Add Sentiment Analysis to Product Suggestions**:\n",
        "   - To add another layer of customization, you can integrate **sentiment analysis** (as we did previously) to adjust the recommendations. For example, if a user seems indecisive or frustrated, you can offer more aggressive promotions or reassurance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Multi-Category Recommendations**:\n",
        "   - Expand the bot to handle multi-category recommendations (e.g., \"I'm looking for outdoor gear, and I need a flask and a lunchbox\"). The bot can recommend a **bundle of products** based on multiple preferences.\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's enhance the bot's flexibility by improving how it parses user input, matches preferences, and provides recommendations. There are a few key reasons why you’re seeing the same response each time:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hardcoded Conditions**: The conditions for triggering promotions or recommendations are rigid, and the bot may always hit the \"promotion\" condition without considering specific user input.\n",
        "2. **Keyword Matching**: The preference matching is too basic, and it doesn't account for variations in how users express their preferences.\n",
        "3. **Budget Handling**: The budget extraction is simplistic, and the bot doesn’t dynamically adjust recommendations based on this input.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Improvements to Make the Bot More Flexible:\n",
        "1. **Improved Keyword Matching**: We'll expand the list of keywords and improve the parsing of user input.\n",
        "2. **Better Response Generation**: We’ll introduce more logic to generate varied and dynamic responses.\n",
        "3. **Enhancing the Budget Logic**: The bot will more effectively handle different budget ranges.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Improvements:\n",
        "1. **More Flexible Keyword Matching**:\n",
        "   - Now, the bot recognizes more flexible phrasing, including variations like **\"show me,\" \"suggest,\"** and **\"can I get.\"** This allows the bot to handle a broader range of inputs for preferences.\n",
        "   - The budget matching is also expanded to include keywords like **\"price\"** and **\"cost\"**, making it easier to trigger budget-based filtering.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Handling No Matches**:\n",
        "   - If no specific product matches the user's preferences, the bot will recommend products purely based on budget.\n",
        "   - This ensures that even if a user provides an ambiguous input, the bot can still offer helpful suggestions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dynamic Promotion Logic**:\n",
        "   - The code now considers the **total price** of selected products to trigger promotions. This avoids the same promotion being triggered for every input.\n",
        "   - For example, if the user mentions a **coffee mug**, the bot offers a \"buy 2, get 1 free\" promotion, but it only recommends the **10% discount** if the total purchase is below $100.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **More Personalized Responses**:\n",
        "   - The bot generates responses based on actual matches or budget-driven recommendations, rather than always returning the same promotional message.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Scenarios:\n",
        "- **User**: \"I'm looking for a flask.\"\n",

        "## Make the Chat Conversational\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, this is exactly where concepts like **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **context-aware recommendations** come into play to make the chatbot more conversational and engaging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s how each of these concepts can help:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:\n",
        "   - **What It Does**: NLP enables the chatbot to understand and process more complex, human-like language. Instead of just matching keywords, the chatbot can **detect intent**, **recognize entities**, and **respond appropriately** based on the context of the conversation.\n",
        "   - **How It Helps**: NLP allows the chatbot to respond in a more natural, conversational way by recognizing subtle variations in user inputs and adjusting responses accordingly. For example, if a user says, *“I’m thinking about getting a water bottle for outdoor activities, but I’m not sure,”* the bot could recognize both **intent** (interest in water bottles) and **sentiment** (hesitation), and respond with reassurance rather than a direct product pitch.\n",
        "   - **Tools You Can Use**:\n",
        "     - **spaCy**: A powerful NLP library that can handle tasks like **intent recognition**, **named entity recognition**, and **dependency parsing**.\n",
        "     - **Transformers**: Models from Hugging Face like BERT or GPT can help with more nuanced understanding of user inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example with NLP:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   import spacy\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Load spaCy's English language model\n",
        "   nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   def parse_user_message(message):\n",
        "       doc = nlp(message)\n",
        "       preferences = []\n",
        "       budget = None\n",
        "       for ent in doc.ents:\n",
        "           if ent.label_ == \"MONEY\":\n",
        "               budget = ent.text\n",
        "           if ent.label_ in [\"PRODUCT\", \"ITEM\"]:\n",
        "               preferences.append(ent.text)\n",
        "       return preferences, budget\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   With NLP, the chatbot can detect specific items (like “flask” or “water bottle”) and also understand budget values. You can even detect **sentiment** to tailor responses based on the user’s mood.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Context-Aware Recommendations**:\n",
        "   - **What It Does**: This involves **storing and leveraging the conversation history** to maintain continuity and create more personalized responses based on prior interactions.\n",
        "   - **How It Helps**: Instead of resetting with each query, the bot can refer back to earlier parts of the conversation, leading to more **natural and engaging dialogues**. For example, if the user first asked for a water bottle, and later mentioned that they are also looking for a lunchbox, the bot could recognize that they are shopping for outdoor gear and recommend a full set.\n",
        "   - **Tools You Can Use**:\n",
        "     - **Storing Session Data**: You can store previous interactions (history) in memory during the chat session, allowing the bot to refer to past exchanges.\n",
        "     - **Personalized Suggestions**: You can make use of **CRM systems** to remember past purchases, preferences, or browsing history.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example with Context-Awareness:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def context_aware_chat(message, history):\n",
        "       # Parse the user input to detect preferences and budget\n",
        "       preferences, budget = parse_user_message(message)\n",
        "\n",
        "       # Check if previous interactions (history) suggest any preferences\n",
        "       for prev_message, prev_response in history:\n",
        "           if \"looking for\" in prev_message.lower() or \"recommend\" in prev_message.lower():\n",
        "               preferences.append(prev_message)\n",
        "\n",
        "       # Use preferences from the entire conversation to provide context-aware recommendations\n",
        "       recommendations = recommend_products(preferences, budget)\n",
        "       \n",
        "       return recommendations\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This way, the chatbot **remembers** the user’s previous queries, allowing it to suggest products based on the overall context of the conversation, not just the latest message.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Make the Conversation Flow More Natural:\n",
        "1. **Understanding the User's Intent**:\n",
        "   - Use NLP techniques to understand what the user is asking for without relying solely on specific keywords. For example, detect whether the user is interested in buying, exploring, or just asking for information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Maintaining Conversation Context**:\n",
        "   - Keep track of user preferences throughout the conversation. If the user asks for a water bottle at the start, the bot should remember that and ask follow-up questions (e.g., \"Do you want a matching lunchbox for your outdoor adventures?\").\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Handling Small Talk or Non-Product Related Queries**:\n",
        "   - If a user engages in small talk or asks questions unrelated to products (e.g., \"How’s the weather?\"), the bot should be able to handle these queries naturally. You can create responses for non-sales questions to keep the conversation engaging and fluid.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Enhancing the Bot’s Conversational Abilities:\n",
        "Here’s how you could **improve the conversational flow** of the bot:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Introduce Follow-up Questions**: After each recommendation, the bot could ask a follow-up question, such as:\n",
        "  - \"Would you like more options under this budget?\"\n",
        "  - \"Are you interested in items that match this product?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Personalization**: By recognizing returning users or referencing their past conversations, the bot can say things like, “Welcome back! Last time you asked about water bottles. Are you still interested in those?”\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sentiment Analysis**: If the user seems unsure, the bot could offer reassurance:\n",
        "  - “I see you’re not sure about the flask. Would you like more information on its features?”\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "- **NLP** will help you build a chatbot that understands more complex inputs, such as preferences or hesitations, and tailors responses in a more human-like way.\n",
        "- **Context-aware recommendations** allow the bot to remember previous interactions, creating a seamless flow of conversation that feels natural and personalized.\n",
        "- Together, these concepts transform the bot from a basic product recommendation engine to a conversational assistant that engages users more effectively and builds rapport over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Would you like to implement some of these changes, or dive deeper into any specific concept like NLP or context-aware recommendations?"
