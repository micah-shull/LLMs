        "\n",
        "#### Brief Description of the `Website` Class:\n",
        "\n",
        "This **`Website` class** is designed to fetch and process the content of a webpage. It performs the following key tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:\n",
        "   - Takes a URL as input.\n",
        "   - Uses the `requests` library to make an HTTP request to the URL. If the request fails (e.g., due to network issues or an invalid URL), it handles the error gracefully and sets the webpage content to \"No content\".\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **HTML Parsing with BeautifulSoup**:\n",
        "   - After successfully retrieving the webpage, it parses the HTML content using the `BeautifulSoup` library.\n",
        "   - Extracts the **title** of the webpage and stores it. If no title is found, it sets the title to \"No title found\".\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Cleaning Irrelevant Elements**:\n",
        "   - It removes irrelevant HTML tags such as `<script>`, `<style>`, `<img>`, and `<input>` to avoid including unnecessary content like JavaScript or CSS in the text.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Extracting the Webpage Text**:\n",
        "   - The class then extracts all text from the webpage’s `<body>` tag and stores it in `self.text`.\n",
        "   - If there is no `<body>` tag, it sets the content to \"No content in body\".\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations of the `Website` Class:\n",
        "1. **Static Text Extraction**:\n",
        "   - This approach only extracts plain text from the webpage. It does not understand or summarize the content. All text, whether relevant or not, is included (e.g., legal notices, footers, or advertisements might be part of the extracted text).\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **No Content Understanding**:\n",
        "   - The class does not distinguish between important and unimportant content, nor does it provide any insights, analysis, or summaries of the text. It only performs basic text extraction and cleaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Comparison to a ChatGPT Summarizer:\n",
        "\n",
        "When using **ChatGPT** to summarize a webpage’s content, it provides several key improvements over this basic text extraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding of Context**:\n",
        "   - ChatGPT understands the context of the text and can identify the main ideas, key points, and important sections of the webpage.\n",
        "   - Instead of extracting raw text, it can generate concise summaries that focus on the essential content.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Intelligent Summarization**:\n",
        "   - Unlike the `Website` class that extracts large chunks of text, ChatGPT will **reduce the length** of the content while preserving the key information, making it more digestible.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Content Prioritization**:\n",
        "   - ChatGPT will prioritize important content (like the main topic or key sections of an article) over irrelevant sections (like ads, headers, or footers) because of its language understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Customization**:\n",
        "   - With ChatGPT, you can provide specific instructions (e.g., \"Summarize the benefits of using `python-dotenv`\") and it will tailor the output based on your needs. The `Website` class just extracts whatever text is available.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. **System Prompt**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "system_prompt = \"You are an assistant that analyzes the contents of a website \\\n",
        "and provides a short summary, ignoring text that might be navigation related. \\\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Explanation:\n",
        "- **Purpose**: The **system prompt** sets up the role of the AI (ChatGPT) and defines how it should behave throughout the interaction.\n",
        "- **Function**:\n",
        "  - **Role Definition**: You tell the assistant that its job is to analyze the contents of a webpage and provide a summary.\n",
        "  - **Instructions**: It specifies that the assistant should ignore navigation-related text (e.g., menus, footers, sidebars), which is often irrelevant to the main content.\n",
        "  - **Response Format**: You instruct the assistant to respond in **Markdown** format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows for easy formatting (e.g., headers, bold text, lists) when rendering the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why It’s Needed:\n",
        "- **Guides the AI’s Behavior**: The system prompt helps set up the assistant’s context, ensuring it knows that it needs to summarize webpage content, ignore irrelevant parts, and return results in a specific format.\n",
        "- **Consistency**: It ensures consistent, structured responses, especially if you want output in a particular format like Markdown.\n",

        "- **Function**:\n",
        "  - **Website Title**: The prompt starts by stating the title of the webpage, helping the assistant understand what the webpage is about.\n",
        "  - **Instructions**: You ask the assistant to provide a short summary in Markdown format. Additionally, you ask it to summarize any news or announcements, making the prompt more tailored to the type of content on the website.\n",
        "  - **Webpage Text**: Finally, the full text extracted from the webpage (stored in `website.text`) is appended to the prompt. This is the data that the assistant will analyze to create the summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why It’s Needed:\n",
        "- **Guides the Assistant**: The **user prompt** directs the assistant by giving it the actual content it needs to summarize, as well as instructions on how to summarize it.\n",
        "- **Custom Instructions**: It provides specific guidance, such as ensuring that news or announcements are summarized, which makes the summary more useful for specific types of content.\n",

        "### How These Prompts Fit Into the ChatGPT API Workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **System Prompt**: Sets the overall context for the conversation and helps the assistant understand its role (in this case, a summarizer).\n",
        "2. **User Prompt**: Supplies the specific content and instructions for what the user wants the assistant to do (in this case, summarizing a website).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Workflow:\n",
        "- **System Prompt**:\n",
        "   - \"You are an assistant that analyzes the contents of a website and provides a short summary, ignoring text that might be navigation related. Respond in markdown.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Combined Result**: ChatGPT uses the system prompt to know how to behave, and the user prompt provides the specific webpage content to analyze and summarize.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Prompts Are Important:\n",
        "- **Contextual Understanding**: Proper prompts help ChatGPT understand the **context**, which in turn improves the quality of its responses.\n",
        "- **Customization**: By customizing the user prompt, you can fine-tune the AI’s behavior for specific tasks, such as summarizing websites, answering questions, or providing technical explanations.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "Now that you have a better understanding of the **system prompt** and **user prompt**, we can move on to integrating this into the **ChatGPT summarizer function** to provide a more robust summary of the webpage content.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the context of **ChatGPT API** (or more specifically, the `ChatCompletion` API in OpenAI), the primary inputs are **system prompts**, **user prompts**, and **assistant responses**. These inputs form part of a structured conversation, where different roles (system, user, assistant) contribute to the interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, you can also customize various aspects of the interaction through additional parameters. Let’s break it down:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Primary Inputs (Core Messages):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **System Prompt**:\n",
        "   - **Role**: `\"system\"`\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Provides the context or defines the role the assistant should play during the interaction. It helps set the stage for the assistant's behavior and tone.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```json\n",
        "     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant that summarizes websites.\"}\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **User Prompt**:\n",
        "   - **Role**: `\"user\"`\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: This is the main input from the user, providing specific instructions or questions that the assistant will respond to. It's the query or task for the assistant to address.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```json\n",
        "     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please summarize the following webpage content: ...\"}\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Assistant Response** (Optional):\n",
        "   - **Role**: `\"assistant\"`\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: This is the response generated by the assistant during multi-turn conversations. It's used to simulate the assistant's prior responses when continuing an ongoing conversation.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```json\n",
        "     {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is a summary of the website: ...\"}\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Structure of a Chat Completion Request:\n",
        "You typically send a list of messages representing the interaction:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "messages = [\n",
        "    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant that summarizes websites.\"},\n",
        "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Summarize the following webpage content: ...\"}\n",
        "]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The assistant will then process these messages and respond based on the provided context and instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional Parameters (Beyond System and User Prompts):\n",
        "\n",
        "The **ChatGPT API** (`ChatCompletion.create`) accepts several additional parameters that help control the behavior of the model:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Model**:\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Specifies which OpenAI model to use. For example, you might use `\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"` or `\"gpt-4\"`.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Max Tokens**:\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Limits the number of tokens (words or subwords) in the model's output. It controls the length of the response.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     max_tokens=150\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Temperature**:\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Controls the **creativity** of the model's responses. A low temperature (e.g., `0.1`) results in more deterministic responses, while a higher temperature (e.g., `0.9`) encourages more randomness and creativity.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     temperature=0.7\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Top_p**:\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: This parameter controls \"nucleus sampling.\" Instead of considering all possible words (tokens) during generation, the model chooses from a subset that represents the top `p` probability mass (e.g., `top_p=0.9` means considering only the most probable tokens until they reach 90% of the probability distribution).\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     top_p=0.9\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Frequency Penalty**:\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Discourages the model from repeating the same lines of text. A higher value reduces repetition.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     frequency_penalty=0.5\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Presence Penalty**:\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Encourages the model to talk about new topics by penalizing previously mentioned topics. This can encourage more diverse outputs.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     presence_penalty=0.5\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Stop Sequences**:\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Specifies a sequence of characters where the model should stop generating text. This is useful for controlling when the response should end (e.g., stopping at a certain delimiter or end of a section).\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     stop=[\"\\n\", \"End of summary\"]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Chat Completion API Request:\n",
        "Here’s how you might structure a request to the ChatGPT API using the system and user prompts, plus additional parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n",

        "    frequency_penalty=0.5,\n",
        "    presence_penalty=0.0,\n",

        "- **System Prompt**: Provides high-level instructions on the role of the assistant (e.g., \"You are an assistant that summarizes websites\").\n",
        "- **User Prompt**: Provides the specific task or question for the assistant (e.g., \"Please summarize the following webpage content\").\n",
        "- **Additional Parameters**: Such as `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, and others can be used to fine-tune the behavior of the model.\n",
        "  \n",
        "Together, these elements give you a lot of control over how ChatGPT interacts and responds in a conversation, allowing for custom prompts and personalized behavior.\n",

        "Now that we have a working web summarizer, we can experiment with prompts to get a better understanding of how they influence the assistant’s behavior and responses. Here are some ways you can toy around with system and user prompts to learn more about how they work.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Experiment with System Prompts:**\n",
        "The system prompt is crucial because it sets the overall behavior of the assistant. By adjusting the system prompt, you can guide the tone, style, or format of the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Examples:\n",
        "- **Change the Tone or Style**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   system_prompt = \"You are a playful assistant that summarizes websites with a humorous and lighthearted tone. Respond in markdown.\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   **Effect**: The assistant might generate a summary in a more casual and humorous tone.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Professional Summarizer**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   system_prompt = \"You are a professional assistant that provides highly detailed and precise summaries of websites in a formal tone. Respond in markdown.\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   **Effect**: The summary will likely be more formal and precise.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Limiting the Summary**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   system_prompt = \"You are an assistant that provides only a brief, one-sentence summary of websites.\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   **Effect**: The assistant will aim to summarize the content in just one sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What You Learn:\n",
        "- How the **assistant’s behavior** can be influenced by setting its \"role\" or \"tone\" in the system prompt.\n",
        "- The importance of being specific and clear when you want particular kinds of output.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Experiment with User Prompts:**\n",
        "User prompts provide specific instructions for the task. You can try different formulations to understand what makes for an effective user prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Examples:\n",
        "- **Asking for Key Information**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   user_prompt = f\"Provide the three most important takeaways from this website titled {website.title}.\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   **Effect**: Instead of a general summary, the assistant will focus on extracting key points or takeaways.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Expanding the Scope**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   user_prompt = f\"Summarize the content of this website and provide suggestions for further reading on the same topic.\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   **Effect**: This encourages the assistant to go beyond summarizing and offer related information.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Highlighting Specific Sections**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   user_prompt = f\"Summarize the news section of this website titled {website.title}. Ignore any unrelated content.\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   **Effect**: The assistant will focus on summarizing just the relevant section and ignore other content.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What You Learn:\n",
        "- How **different instructions** in the user prompt impact the detail, focus, and structure of the assistant’s response.\n",
        "- How you can tailor user prompts to get more actionable, focused, or concise answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Test Prompt Interactions:**\n",
        "Prompts interact with each other. For example, the system prompt may ask the assistant to be professional, while the user prompt might ask for something more casual. You can test how these prompts interact and prioritize.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Examples:\n",
        "- **Contrasting Prompts**:\n",
        "   - **System Prompt**: \"You are a highly formal and professional assistant.\"\n",
        "   - **User Prompt**: \"Give me a super casual, chill summary of this website.\"\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Effect**: The model may prioritize one over the other. Experimenting like this helps you understand how the system prompt and user prompt balance each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What You Learn:\n",
        "- How **conflicting instructions** impact the output.\n",
        "- Which prompt seems to carry more weight depending on the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Adding Constraints to the Output:**\n",
        "You can also experiment with prompts by placing constraints on the output, such as length limits or specific formats.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Examples:\n",
        "- **Length Constraints**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   user_prompt = f\"Provide a summary of this website in no more than 50 words.\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Specific Formatting**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   user_prompt = f\"Summarize this website in the form of a bullet-point list.\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What You Learn:\n",
        "- How well the assistant can follow **structural constraints** like length or formatting.\n",
        "- How to formulate prompts for specific kinds of responses (e.g., bulleted lists, structured formats).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Modify Based on Feedback**:\n",
        "Try modifying the user prompts based on how the model responds. You may want to tweak wording or provide additional details based on the output you receive.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "- **Original User Prompt**: \"Summarize the website.\"\n",
        "- **Feedback**: The output was too general.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Improved Prompt**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   user_prompt = f\"Summarize the website in a detailed paragraph, focusing on the key arguments or points made in the text.\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What You Learn:\n",
        "- How **iterative refinement** of prompts can improve the quality of responses.\n",

        "   - **Purpose**: The system prompt defines the **role**, **tone**, and **behavior** of the assistant throughout the interaction. It sets up the context for how the assistant should approach the task.\n",
        "   - **When It’s Used**: Typically used once at the beginning of a conversation to establish the assistant's identity or guide its behavior in the rest of the interaction.\n",
        "   - **Function**: Think of the system prompt as instructions for **how** the assistant should behave, without providing task-specific content. It affects the assistant’s overall tone, personality, or conversational style.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant that provides concise and accurate technical information.\"}\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   In this example, the assistant is guided to provide **concise and accurate** information during the conversation.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Common Uses:\n",
        "   - Defining the assistant’s tone (e.g., professional, casual, humorous).\n",
        "   - Specifying the assistant’s role (e.g., acting as a teacher, summarizer, customer service agent).\n",
        "   - Establishing broad behavioral guidelines (e.g., the assistant should **always** be helpful, friendly, and polite).\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. **User Prompts**:\n",
        "   - **Role**: `\"user\"`\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: The user prompt provides **task-specific** input. It tells the assistant exactly what the user wants it to do. This is where the actual questions or instructions for completing the task are provided.\n",
        "   - **When It’s Used**: User prompts are the **main interaction** in the conversation. Each time the user wants the assistant to perform a task, it sends a user prompt.\n",
        "   - **Function**: It instructs the assistant on **what** to do, such as answering a question, summarizing content, or performing a specific task.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please summarize the following article about machine learning.\"}\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Common Uses:\n",
        "   - Asking the assistant to perform tasks (e.g., \"Translate this text\", \"Summarize this website\").\n",
        "   - Asking questions (e.g., \"What is the theory of relativity?\").\n",
        "   - Providing specific details (e.g., \"Please explain this Python code step by step.\").\n",
