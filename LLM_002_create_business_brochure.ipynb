        "\n",
        "### What Are System Prompts and Why Are They Needed?\n",
        "\n",
        "**System prompts** are instructions provided to the model to establish its role, behavior, or how it should approach a particular task. In the OpenAI API, the system prompt helps define the context and rules for how the assistant should interact throughout the conversation. It sets the groundwork for the assistant's behavior before any specific tasks or questions (from the user prompt) are asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of System Prompts:\n",
        "1. **Set Expectations**: The system prompt defines what the model is expected to do during the interaction. For example, it tells the model that it should focus on certain content or follow specific guidelines when generating responses.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Guide Behavior**: It helps guide the tone, structure, and style of the model’s responses. For example, the system prompt can ask the model to respond in a specific format (like JSON), maintain a professional tone, or ignore irrelevant content.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Establish Context**: It provides the initial context for the task, so the model knows how to handle user queries or instructions. System prompts help ensure consistency in responses by maintaining the same behavior throughout a conversation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What This System Prompt Does:\n",
        "1. **Role Definition**: It clearly defines that the model’s job is to analyze a list of links and determine which are most relevant for a specific purpose (e.g., creating a brochure about a company). This frames the model’s behavior.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Task-Specific Instructions**: It gives specific examples of the kinds of links that should be selected (e.g., About page, Careers/Jobs page), guiding the model on what to look for in the links.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Response Format**: It specifies that the model should respond in a **JSON format**, ensuring that the output is structured and machine-readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why This System Prompt Is Important:\n",
        "- **Maintains Structure**: It ensures that the model returns output in the correct JSON format. Without this instruction, the model might respond with free text or unstructured data.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Focuses the Model**: By explicitly mentioning types of relevant links (e.g., About, Careers), it narrows down the model’s decision-making to select only the links relevant to the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Consistency**: System prompts are necessary to ensure that the model behaves consistently across multiple interactions or tasks, maintaining the same structure and focus throughout the conversation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "System prompts provide **high-level guidance** that sets the behavior, tone, and format of responses for a model. In your case, the **link_system_prompt** ensures that the model selects specific types of links and returns them in a clear, structured format. This is critical when you want the model to perform specific tasks with consistent, high-quality output."

        "4. **Handles Relative Links**: It mentions that some links may be relative links (which lack the full domain name), guiding the model to handle them properly.\n",
        "   - Example: \"Links (some might be relative links):\"\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Provides the Data**: The list of links from the website is appended to the prompt. This gives the model the data it needs to analyze and generate a relevant output.\n",
        "   - Example: `\"\\n\".join(website.links)` adds the actual list of links.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why This User Prompt Is Important:\n",
        "- **Provides Context**: It gives the model a specific task (choosing relevant links for a brochure) based on the context of the website.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Clarifies Expectations**: The prompt clearly states what types of links to exclude (e.g., Terms of Service, Privacy, email links) and what format to return the results in (JSON), helping the model deliver the right output.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Task-Oriented**: The user prompt ensures the model focuses on the specific task of evaluating web links for relevance to a brochure, rather than just returning all links or providing general information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "User prompts are critical because they tell the model exactly what it needs to do with the provided data. In this case, the **get_links_user_prompt** gives the model a clear task (evaluating website links), excludes certain types of irrelevant links, and asks for the output in a structured JSON format. This ensures the model understands the task and produces a relevant and structured response."

        "### User Prompt Code Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Does It Use `+=`?\n",
        "\n",
        "The `+=` operator in this context is used to **incrementally build the `user_prompt` string** by adding different parts of the message one after the other. This allows you to create the final string in multiple steps, which is helpful for a few reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Readability**:\n",
        "   - Breaking the string up across several lines and appending it piece by piece makes the code more **readable** and **maintainable**.\n",
        "   - If all the text were written in one long string, it would be harder to follow or edit because of the length and complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Modularity**:\n",
        "   - Using `+=` allows you to easily **modify or insert** additional content at different points in the prompt. For instance, if you wanted to add more information after the list of links, it would be easy to do by appending another line.\n",
        "   - It also makes it easy to understand which part of the prompt is responsible for what (i.e., instructions, list of links, exclusions).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Handling Dynamic Data**:\n",
        "   - Parts of the string, like the `website.url` or the list of `website.links`, are **dynamic**. The prompt is being built incrementally, allowing for the insertion of these dynamic elements wherever needed.\n",
        "   - It’s common to use `+=` when you are adding dynamic data because the structure of the string can be built in steps and adjusted more easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Easier Debugging**:\n",
        "   - If there's a problem with the constructed string (e.g., formatting or incorrect instructions), you can easily debug and fix specific parts of the string when it's built incrementally.\n",
        "   - If all the text is written in one long string, it might be more difficult to find errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Could This Be Written as One Long String?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, it could be written as a single string using **f-string** formatting with everything included at once. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def get_links_user_prompt(website):\n",
        "    return f\"Here is the list of links on the website of {website.url} - please decide which of these are relevant web links for a brochure about the company, respond with the full https URL in JSON format. Do not include Terms of Service, Privacy, email links.\\nLinks (some might be relative links):\\n\" + \"\\n\".join(website.links)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this approach:\n",
        "- Would make the string **less modular** and harder to edit.\n",
        "- Would become **unwieldy** if you had to change or add more sections of text.\n",
        "- Could make it **more difficult to read and debug** if there are issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "The `+=` operator is used to **incrementally** build the `user_prompt` for better readability, modularity, and ease of handling dynamic content. While it’s possible to write the entire prompt as one long string, doing so would reduce the flexibility and clarity of the code, especially when handling dynamic elements like `website.url` and `website.links`."

        "## Get Links Function\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Detailed Breakdown of Each Step:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`website = Website(url)`**:\n",
        "   - This line creates an instance of the `Website` class by passing the `url` as an argument.\n",
        "   - The `Website` class presumably extracts content and links from the given URL, making it ready for the model to process. The specific functionality of `Website` is assumed to be defined elsewhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`openai.chat.completions.create(...)`**:\n",
        "   - This line calls the **OpenAI API** to generate a response based on the model (`MODEL`) and the provided prompts. It sends a request to the API to analyze the extracted links and return relevant ones in **JSON format**.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **Parameters**:\n",
        "     - `model=MODEL`: Specifies which model to use (e.g., `\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"` or `\"gpt-4\"`).\n",
        "     - `messages`: This is a list of messages that the model will process. It contains:\n",
        "       - **System Prompt**: `{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": link_system_prompt}`. This defines how the model should behave (e.g., analyze the links and return relevant ones).\n",
        "       - **User Prompt**: `{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": get_links_user_prompt(website)}`. This is a dynamic prompt generated by the function `get_links_user_prompt()` based on the content of the website. It specifies what the model should do with the links (e.g., choose relevant ones for a company brochure).\n",
        "     - `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}`: This ensures that the response is formatted as a **JSON object**. The system prompt should also contain instructions that the output should be in JSON.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`result = completion.choices[0].message.content`**:\n",
        "   - The OpenAI API returns a **completion object**, which contains multiple choices (though typically just one for ChatCompletion).\n",
        "   - `completion.choices[0].message.content` extracts the **content** from the first choice in the response (i.e., the result returned by the model).\n",
        "   - The result is expected to be a string representing a JSON object, as requested by the `response_format` and the system prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`return json.loads(result)`**:\n",
        "   - The `json.loads()` function is used to convert the **JSON-formatted string** (returned by the model) into a **Python dictionary**.\n",
        "   - The function returns this dictionary, which contains the relevant links in the desired JSON format.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Workflow:\n",
        "1. **User Input**: You provide a webpage URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).\n",
        "2. **Website Class**: The `Website(url)` object extracts the list of links from the given webpage.\n",
        "3. **Model Interaction**: The model is given two prompts:\n",
        "   - The **system prompt** (`link_system_prompt`) defines how the model should behave (e.g., analyze links, return JSON).\n",
        "   - The **user prompt** (`get_links_user_prompt(website)`) provides the specific task (i.e., choose relevant links for a brochure).\n",
        "4. **Model Output**: The model processes the links and returns relevant ones (e.g., About page, Careers page) in JSON format.\n",

        "- This function allows you to pass a **URL** to the model and receive a **filtered list of relevant links** (e.g., for a company brochure) as a JSON object. It streamlines the process of identifying important website links and structures them in a machine-readable format.\n",

        "- **Error Handling**: You may want to add error handling to manage cases where the API response is empty, invalid, or the website doesn't have any links.\n",
        "- **Flexible Output**: You could allow for different output formats (e.g., XML, plain text) if needed by adjusting the system prompt and `response_format`.\n",

        "This function, `get_all_details(url)`, is designed to extract the contents of a webpage, then gather relevant links from that webpage, and finally retrieve and concatenate the content of the linked pages as well. The function constructs a single string that includes the contents of the landing page and all the linked pages categorized by their type (e.g., \"About page\", \"Careers page\").\n",
        "\n",
        "### What the Function Does:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`result = \"Landing page:\\n\"`**:\n",
        "   - Initializes a string called `result` with the label \"Landing page:\". This will hold the entire output, starting with the landing page's content.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`result += Website(url).get_contents()`**:\n",
        "   - Creates a `Website` object for the provided URL (i.e., the landing page) and calls the `get_contents()` method to extract its content. The content is appended to the `result` string.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`links = get_links(url)`**:\n",
        "   - Calls the `get_links()` function to extract relevant links from the landing page. This function is expected to return a dictionary where `links[\"links\"]` contains a list of links in JSON format (e.g., \"about page\", \"careers page\", etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`print(\"Found links:\", links)`**:\n",
        "   - Prints the found links to the console for debugging purposes, allowing you to see which links were extracted from the landing page.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **`for link in links[\"links\"]:`**:\n",
        "   - Loops through each link in the list of relevant links.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **`result += f\"\\n\\n{link['type']}\\n\"`**:\n",
        "   - Appends the **type** of each link (e.g., \"about page\", \"careers page\") to the result, using a new line to format the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **`result += Website(link[\"url\"]).get_contents()`**:\n",
        "   - For each link, creates a new `Website` object using the link’s URL and calls `get_contents()` to retrieve the content of the linked page. This content is also appended to the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **`return result`**:\n",
        "   - Returns the final string containing the contents of the landing page followed by the contents of all the linked pages.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Improvements to the Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Error Handling**:\n",
        "   - Add error handling to gracefully handle cases where links may be broken, contents cannot be fetched, or the webpage does not have any links.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Code Cleanup**:\n",
        "   - Avoid constructing the `result` string in multiple steps using `+=` (which may not be the most efficient way to handle long strings in Python). Instead, use a list to accumulate strings and join them at the end for better performance with large amounts of text.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reduce Repeated Calls**:\n",
        "   - Avoid creating multiple `Website` objects for the same URL by reusing the `Website` object, especially for the landing page.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cleaned-Up Version:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def get_all_details(url):\n",
        "    # Step 1: Create a list to accumulate the result contents\n",
        "    result_parts = []\n",
        "    \n",
        "    # Step 2: Add the landing page content\n",
        "    landing_page = Website(url)\n",
        "    result_parts.append(\"Landing page:\\n\")\n",
        "    result_parts.append(landing_page.get_contents())\n",
        "    \n",
        "    # Step 3: Get relevant links from the landing page\n",
        "    links = get_links(url)\n",
        "    print(\"Found links:\", links)  # Debug: Print the found links\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Step 4: Loop through each relevant link, fetch its content, and add it to the result\n",
        "    for link in links[\"links\"]:\n",
        "        # Add the type of the link (e.g., \"about page\") and its contents\n",
        "        result_parts.append(f\"\\n\\n{link['type']}\\n\")\n",
        "        linked_page = Website(link[\"url\"])  # Create a Website object for each link\n",
        "        result_parts.append(linked_page.get_contents())\n",
        "    \n",
        "    # Step 5: Join the result_parts list into a single string and return it\n",
        "    return ''.join(result_parts)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Efficient String Handling**:\n",
        "   - Instead of repeatedly appending to the string with `+=`, we accumulate parts of the result in a list (`result_parts`). At the end, we use `''.join(result_parts)` to join the list into a single string, which is more efficient for larger texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reusing Objects**:\n",
        "   - The code reuses the `Website` object to avoid recreating it multiple times for the same URL. This might be useful if the object is complex or expensive to create.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Clarity and Maintainability**:\n",
        "   - The code is now easier to maintain and expand, with each logical step clearly separated.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "This function is designed to gather the content from a landing page and its relevant linked pages, and return the complete content as a single string. The improvements enhance the efficiency of string handling and make the code more maintainable."

        "### Code Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "This function, `create_brochure(company_name, url)`, is designed to generate a company brochure by calling the OpenAI API. It sends both the **system prompt** and the **user prompt** to the model and then processes and displays the result as markdown. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:\n",
        "\n",
        "### What the Code Does:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Calls the OpenAI API (`openai.chat.completions.create()`)**:\n",
        "   - This method makes an API call to OpenAI's language model using the specified model (`MODEL`) and a list of messages. The messages include:\n",
        "     - **System Prompt**: `system_prompt` defines the behavior and role of the model (e.g., to create a professional or humorous brochure).\n",
        "     - **User Prompt**: `get_brochure_user_prompt(company_name, url)` generates the user prompt based on the company’s name and webpage content.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Processes the Response**:\n",
        "   - The API returns a **completion object**, which contains one or more generated choices. The function retrieves the first choice from the response with `response.choices[0].message.content`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Displays the Brochure in Markdown Format**:\n",
        "   - The `Markdown(result)` function converts the generated content into markdown format and displays it. This makes the brochure visually appealing when displayed in environments that support markdown (e.g., Jupyter notebooks).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of Each Step:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **System and User Prompts**:\n",
        "  - These are critical to guiding the model's behavior. The **system prompt** defines how the model behaves (e.g., professional, concise), and the **user prompt** tells the model what specific task to perform (i.e., creating the brochure based on the company’s website).\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **API Response**:\n",
        "  - After calling the API, the result contains the content of the brochure, which is formatted in markdown for easy reading.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Code is Important:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Prompt Structure**:\n",
        "   - The system and user prompts define the behavior and task for the model, ensuring it generates a brochure based on relevant content from the company's website. The system prompt guides the model’s behavior (e.g., formal or humorous), and the user prompt provides specific content for the model to process.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Markdown Formatting**:\n",
        "   - Using markdown allows the brochure to be presented in a visually appealing way, especially in environments like Jupyter notebooks, where markdown can be rendered directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **API Integration**:\n",
        "   - This function seamlessly integrates with OpenAI’s API, making it easy to generate customized content (in this case, a company brochure) programmatically.\n",
