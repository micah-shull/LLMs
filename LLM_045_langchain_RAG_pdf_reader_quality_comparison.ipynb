        "## **What is RAG?**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Introduction to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a framework that combines **information retrieval** with **language model generation**. It enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to retrieve relevant content from external sources (e.g., documents, databases, or APIs) and use that information to generate accurate and context-aware responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike standard LLMs, which rely solely on their pre-trained knowledge (limited by a knowledge cutoff date), RAG enhances their ability to provide real-time, domain-specific, or custom responses by dynamically accessing external knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Why is RAG Important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Overcomes Knowledge Limitations**:\n",
        "   - Pre-trained LLMs lack knowledge of events or information beyond their training data. RAG solves this by allowing the model to query external sources for up-to-date or domain-specific information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Improves Accuracy**:\n",
        "   - By retrieving relevant content, RAG helps generate more factual and precise responses, reducing hallucinations (when an LLM generates incorrect or made-up information).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Enables Domain-Specific Applications**:\n",
        "   - RAG can be applied to specialized domains (e.g., legal, healthcare, or research) by retrieving from custom knowledge bases or document sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Efficient Use of Resources**:\n",
        "   - Rather than fine-tuning an LLM for specific tasks, RAG allows you to **retrieve and utilize knowledge dynamically**, making it more efficient and cost-effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How RAG Works**:\n",
        "RAG typically involves the following steps:\n",
        "1. **Document Indexing**:\n",
        "   - Convert a collection of documents into vector representations (embeddings) and store them in a **vector database** (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Query Embedding and Retrieval**:\n",
        "   - Convert the user’s query into an embedding and perform a **similarity search** to find the most relevant documents from the vector store.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Generation**:\n",
        "   - Combine the retrieved documents with the query and feed them into an LLM to generate a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Use Cases of RAG**:\n",
        "- **Document-Based Question Answering**: Answer questions based on a knowledge base (e.g., company manuals, research papers).\n",
        "- **Chatbots with External Knowledge**: Build chatbots that use real-time or custom data.\n",
        "- **Search-Enhanced Applications**: Improve search engines by retrieving and summarizing information.\n",
        "- **Content Summarization and Insight Extraction**: Summarize large documents or extract key insights.\n",

            "The Corporate Collector: These are businesses or corporate entities buying art for their offices, lobbies, or corporate events. The intent is often to improve workplace aesthetics, inspire creativity, or to enhance their brand image. Artists who can create large-scale works or pieces that resonate with corporate values can find opportunities here. a. Offer corporate packages or create art that aligns with corporate values. I’m thinking about: Corporate Art Leasing, Tailored Commissions, Team Building Workshops, Corporate Gifting, Lobby Installations, Art Consultation for their corporate spaces,The Gallery Affiliate: These collectors are often linked to or own galleries. They look for artists who not only fit their gallery’s theme but also have potential for future exhibitions. Building relationships with these collectors can lead to long-term gallery representation. a. Build relationships with galleries and offer exclusivity or commission-based partnerships.\n",

            "The Educator Collector: Often educators or academicians, they buy art to teach, for research, or to promote artistic appreciation among students. Artists who produce thought-provoking or historically relevant works can find a niche with this group. a. Offer educational discounts and make it easy for educational institutions to collaborate with you. I’m thinking about: Educator Discounts, Workshops for Students, Collaborative Research (work with academics on research projects), Art Loan Programs,… Interactive Exhibitions: Create exhibitions within educational institutions that not only display art but also encourage viewer interaction, fostering deeper engagement and understanding.The Cause-Supporting Collector: These collectors purchase art to support specific causes or charities. Whether it’s social justice, animal rights, or any other cause, artists who align with these values or contribute to these causes can attract their attention. a. Partner with NGOs or create art series that support specific causes.\n",

            "The Traveler Collector: They collect art from places they’ve visited, encapsulating memories of their journeys. Artists from tourist destinations or those capturing the essence of a location can cater to these collectors. a. Capture the essence of popular destinations or offer artworks at tourist hotspots.The Art Fair Regular: These collectors are frequent visitors to art fairs, looking for new talents and pieces to add to their collections. Presence in prominent art fairs can help artists get noticed by this group. a. Ensure a presence at major art fairs and engage with regular attendees. Put a large portion of your advertisement and marketing budget in art fair representation and art fair things.The Family Legacy Collector: They inherit and continue the art collection legacy of their families. They often look for artworks that complement their existing collection. Artists whose style or theme aligns with historic or time-honored traditions can be of interest to them. a. Research historic art trends and create complementary pieces that align with such traditions.The Bargain Hunter: This collector is always on the lookout for undervalued pieces, estate sales, or artists who haven’t been ‘discovered’ yet. They pride themselves on getting art at a lower price point and potentially finding hidden gems. This collector is not necessarily cheap. What they value is the ability to brag about what amazing decisions they’ve made and how they foresee the future. The art becomes a representation of their ability to find undervalued things. a. Offer occasional discounts, bundle deals, or spotlight emerging talents with affordable art. Provide insights into the potential of undervalued pieces.Futurist collector: Collectors that are market mavens with a particular taste that is very, very specific. They have a vision about the art world right now and about what art and beauty should be in the future, and they collect in line with that vision. They only collect in line with that vision. a. Join panels, symposiums, or talks focusing on the future of art. This can elevate your reputation in the eyes of Futurist collectors as well as help you connect with them. Aim to have your works featured in avant-garde galleries or spaces known for cutting-edge contemporary art. These don’t have to be high end galleries.Combo: The reality is that most collectors are a combination of several personality types addressed here. It’s important to understand that collectors are rarely one personality type only. Note: The rules in the art world are very simple. Whoever understands art collectors best will have the best offer and whoever has the best offer will sell most art. This is a game that is won through psychology. I’m sure you will be able to use this collector personality type list without my help since you are more than capable of figuring things out on your own. But if you would like some help. I have a section in The Artist Formula where I explain how I use this to make an offer that is irresistible to collectors. And if you want more free tools go to driesketels.com\n",

        "#### **Overview of the Notebook**\n",
        "In this notebook, we successfully built a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to extract, retrieve, and generate answers from a PDF document. The workflow focused on ensuring **high-quality input and output** by addressing various challenges encountered along the way.\n",

        "### **Key Steps Taken**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **PDF Text Extraction**:\n",
        "   - We started by extracting text from a PDF using **PyMuPDF (fitz)** after identifying that LangChain's `PyPDFLoader` struggled with mixed text and image content.\n",
        "   - PyMuPDF provided clean and accurate extraction of the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cleaning the Extracted Text**:\n",
        "   - The extracted text contained artifacts like isolated numbers, unnecessary whitespace, and formatting issues.\n",
        "   - We implemented a **pre-cleaning function** using regex to:\n",
        "     - Remove page numbers or random artifacts.\n",
        "     - Normalize newlines and spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Logical Text Chunking**:\n",
        "   - To ensure retrieval accuracy, we split the text into meaningful **chunks**.\n",
        "   - Instead of arbitrary chunking, we used a **pattern-based approach** with regex to split the text at **\"The [Personality Type] Collector:\"**.\n",
        "   - This method ensured that each chunk corresponded to a distinct personality type, preserving context.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Vectorization and Storage**:\n",
        "   - Each cleaned chunk was converted into embeddings using **`OpenAIEmbeddings`** and stored in a **FAISS vector store**.\n",
        "   - FAISS allowed us to efficiently retrieve the most relevant chunks based on a user query.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Retrieval and Generation**:\n",
        "   - We queried the vector store to retrieve the most relevant personality type descriptions.\n",
        "   - The retrieved context was passed to an **LLM** (GPT-4) with a structured prompt to generate a concise and accurate answer.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **PDF Format**:\n",
        "   - **Issue**: PDFs can contain a mix of text, images, and hidden formatting artifacts.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Use a robust library like **PyMuPDF** for text-based PDFs and OCR-based tools (e.g., `UnstructuredPDFLoader` with Tesseract) for image-based PDFs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Text Artifacts**:\n",
        "   - **Issue**: Extracted text may contain page numbers, headers, footers, or random symbols.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Implement a **pre-cleaning step** using regex to remove unwanted content.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Chunking Strategy**:\n",
        "   - **Issue**: Arbitrary chunking (e.g., fixed character chunks) can split related content, reducing retrieval relevance.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Use **pattern-based splitting** for structured content (e.g., splitting at section headers or keywords).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Retrieval Accuracy**:\n",
        "   - **Issue**: Irrelevant or incomplete chunks can be retrieved, affecting the LLM’s output quality.\n",
        "   - **Solution**:\n",
        "     - Retrieve the top **2-3 relevant chunks** to provide sufficient context.\n",
        "     - Verify the retrieved content before passing it to the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Prompt Design for LLMs**:\n",
        "   - **Issue**: Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model, leading to inaccurate responses.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Use a clear and consistent **\"Context + Question + Answer\"** prompt format to guide the LLM.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Quality of Input Determines Quality of Output**:\n",
        "   - Garbage in, garbage out. Cleaning and preparing the input text (e.g., pre-processing and logical chunking) is **critical** for high-quality retrieval and generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Choosing the Right Tools Matters**:\n",
        "   - Switching from `PyPDFLoader` to **PyMuPDF** greatly improved text extraction reliability.\n",
        "   - Always choose tools suited to your data type (e.g., OCR for image-based PDFs).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Semantic Chunking is Key**:\n",
        "   - Breaking text into logical sections, rather than arbitrary chunks, ensures better retrieval accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Iterative Debugging**:\n",
        "   - Breaking the RAG pipeline into smaller steps (e.g., loading, cleaning, chunking, embedding) allowed us to identify and fix issues incrementally.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Structured Prompts Drive Better Results**:\n",
        "   - Providing clear context to the LLM leads to more relevant and concise answers.\n",
