        "1. **Easily Parseable**: Each section is clearly defined, making it easier to pull out specific information, like product offerings, services, or contact information.\n",

        "3. **Scalability**: As the content grows, you can easily add more products, services, or sections without restructuring the entire JSON.\n",
        "4. **Cleaner Data**: Markdown formatting is avoided, which reduces parsing complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Plan:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Modify `create_brochure()`**: Instead of generating one long Markdown string, generate structured sections and store them in a dictionary.\n",
        "2. **Save to JSON**: When saving the data, structure it according to the JSON layout above.\n",
        "3. **Access for the Chatbot**: When retrieving the JSON data, it can easily reference specific parts, such as product offerings or services.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "If you agree with this structure, we can:\n",
        "1. Modify the `create_brochure()` function to generate data in this structured format.\n",
        "2. Update the JSON saving logic to store the data in this structured format.\n",
        "3. Ensure the chatbot can access the data more easily by referencing specific sections when needed.\n"
