        "\n",
        "These imports are used to create structured prompts for interacting with LLMs in a conversational format. Here’s what each one does:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **a. `ChatPromptTemplate`**\n",
        "- **What it does**: Combines multiple message templates (system and human messages) into a single, reusable chat prompt.\n",
        "- **Why it's useful**:\n",
        "  - Helps organize conversations by defining clear roles and context (e.g., the system provides instructions, while the user gives specific queries).\n",
        "  - Allows dynamic formatting by inserting variables (e.g., `{dietary_preference}`).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **b. `SystemMessagePromptTemplate`**\n",
        "- **What it does**: Defines the system's role or behavior in the conversation.\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  - A system message like `\"You are a helpful assistant\"` sets the tone and behavior for the LLM.\n",
        "  - These messages are not user-input specific but guide the model's overall interaction style.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **c. `HumanMessagePromptTemplate`**\n",
        "- **What it does**: Captures the user's input in a structured way.\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  - A template like `\"{recipe_request}\"` dynamically includes user-specific queries, such as `\"I need a quick snack idea.\"`\n",
        "  - This makes the prompt adaptable to different inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **`from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI`**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **a. `ChatOpenAI`**\n",
        "- **What it does**: This is the interface for interacting with OpenAI's chat-based models (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`).\n",
        "- **Why it's useful**:\n",
        "  - Abstracts the complexity of calling OpenAI's API by providing an easy-to-use Python object.\n",
        "  - Allows configuration of model parameters like temperature, model version, and API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Key Features**:\n",
        "- **Temperature**: Controls randomness in responses (higher values = more creative).\n",
        "- **Model**: Specifies which OpenAI model to use (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`).\n",
        "- **API Key Integration**: Handles authentication for querying OpenAI's servers.\n",

        "### **How These Imports Work Together**\n",
        "1. **Prompt Creation (`ChatPromptTemplate`)**:\n",
        "   - Combines `SystemMessagePromptTemplate` (for context) and `HumanMessagePromptTemplate` (for user input) into a structured prompt.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     You are an AI recipe assistant that specializes in Vegan dishes that can be prepared in 15 minutes.\n",
        "     I need a quick snack idea.\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **ChatOpenAI**:\n",
        "   - Takes the structured prompt created by `ChatPromptTemplate` and sends it to an OpenAI model (e.g., `gpt-4`) for generating a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why These Imports Are Useful\n",
        "- They provide **modularity** and **clarity**:\n",
        "  - System and user prompts are separated into templates for reusability.\n",
        "  - ChatOpenAI handles model interactions, keeping API calls simple and readable.\n",
        "- They are **flexible**:\n",
        "  - You can dynamically update prompts based on user input.\n",
        "  - You can switch between OpenAI models by simply changing parameters in `ChatOpenAI`.\n",

            "Once upon a time, in the mid-19th century, the United States was a nation divided. The year was 1861, and tensions between the Northern states, known as the Union, and the Southern states, which had seceded to form the Confederacy, had reached a boiling point. The issue of slavery was at the heart of this conflict, with the South relying on the institution for its agricultural economy, while the North was increasingly moving toward abolition and industrialization.\n",
            "\n",
            "In a small town in Virginia, a young man named Samuel Thompson found himself caught in the turmoil. Samuel was a farmer’s son, raised in a family that had owned slaves for generations. However, as he grew older, he began to question the morality of slavery and the way it dehumanized people. He often found himself in heated debates with his friends, some of whom were staunch supporters of the Confederacy.\n",
            "\n",
            "When the war broke out, Samuel felt a deep conflict within him. He loved his home and his family, but he also felt a growing sense of duty to fight for what he believed was right. After much contemplation, he made the difficult decision to join the Union Army, hoping to help preserve the nation and end the suffering of enslaved people.\n",
            "\n",
            "As Samuel marched off to war, he left behind his childhood sweetheart, Clara, who was heartbroken but proud of his bravery. She promised to wait for him, believing that love could withstand even the darkest of times.\n",
            "\n",
            "The war was brutal and unforgiving. Samuel fought in several key battles, including the First Battle of Bull Run and the Battle of Antietam, where he witnessed the horrors of war firsthand. The sights and sounds of battle haunted him, but he remained resolute in his belief that he was fighting for a just cause.\n",
            "\n",
            "One fateful day, during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, Samuel found himself in the thick of the fighting. The Union and Confederate forces clashed fiercely, and the air was thick with smoke and the cries of the wounded. In the chaos, Samuel spotted a Confederate soldier who had fallen, injured and alone. As he approached, he recognized the soldier as his childhood friend, Thomas, who had chosen to fight for the South.\n",
            "\n",
            "In that moment, Samuel faced a profound moral dilemma. He could have easily turned away, but instead, he knelt beside Thomas, who was gasping for breath. “I’m sorry, Samuel,” Thomas whispered, tears in his eyes. “I didn’t want it to come to this.”\n",
            "\n",
            "With the sounds of battle raging around them, Samuel made a choice that would define his character. He helped Thomas to safety, risking his own life to save someone he had once called a brother. They were both captured by Union forces but were later released after the battle. The experience changed Samuel; he realized that the war was not just about North versus South, but about humanity and compassion.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the war dragged on, Samuel and Clara exchanged letters, their love growing stronger despite the distance and uncertainty. Clara became an active supporter of the Union cause, volunteering as a nurse and helping wounded soldiers. She often wrote to Samuel about her experiences, and her words filled him with hope.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, in April 1865, the war came to an end with the surrender of General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House. Samuel returned home, weary but triumphant. He found Clara waiting for him, her heart full of love and pride. They embraced, knowing that they had both fought for a better future.\n",

            "The Civil War had changed the nation forever, and it had transformed Samuel and Clara as well.

He was a farmer, working the land that had been in his family for generations. The winds of change began to stir, however, as the debate over slavery intensified. Thomas believed that the institution of slavery was essential for the economic prosperity of the South, but he also had friends in the North, including a spirited abolitionist named Clara, who visited him during the summer months.\n",

The air was thick with smoke, the sounds of cannon fire and the cries of wounded men filled his ears. In the chaos, he caught a glimpse of the opposing side—young men just like him, fighting for their own beliefs and homes.

The ideals he once held so dearly began to crumble under the weight of the suffering around him.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the winter of 1863, during a brutal campaign, Thomas was injured at the Battle of Fredericksburg. As he lay in a makeshift hospital, he found himself reflecting on the choices he had made. It was there that he encountered Clara, who had come to care for the wounded. Their eyes met, and in that moment, the years of conflict faded away. They spoke for hours, sharing their hopes, fears, and the realities of war. Clara’s compassion and conviction began to soften Thomas’s heart.\n",

The war continued, but he began to question the very foundations of his beliefs. He and Clara worked together in their town, advocating for peace and reconciliation. They held meetings, telling stories of their experiences, fostering understanding between Union and Confederate sympathizers.\n",

Clara learned to tend to the grisly wounds, creating a space of comfort amidst the chaos.\n",

It was on those blood-soaked fields that she learned of Thomas’s fate. He was wounded, a bullet having shattered his knee, but somehow he survived.\n",

They journeyed through thick forests and across streams, dodging battles and skirmishes, driven by Clara’s unwavering resolve to bring her brother home.\n",

There, she spotted Thomas, pale and gaunt, his leg bandaged but adorned with the courage of a soldier.\n",

            "\n",
            "Those words struck Clara deeply. She realized the fight was not just for a fractured nation but for the very souls imprisoned by their circumstances. Inspired, she chose to stay at the camp, determined to help in any way she could. As battles raged on, she found her purpose in advocating for the wounded and advocating against the injustices of slavery, touching the lives of many soldiers, regardless of their uniforms.\n",
